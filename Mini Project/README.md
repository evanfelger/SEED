The purpose of this repository is to share the code our team developed amongst ourselves in order to complete the Mini Project Demonstration for EENG350. 

The names for each file containing code are indicative of their purpose in the project. For example, the file that is titled: "mini project camera, aruco detection, lcd display.py", controls the camera, aruco detection and lcd display in this project.
